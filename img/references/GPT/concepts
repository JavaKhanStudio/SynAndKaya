Most Important Flower in Cocker Spaniel History
ðŸ”¹ Heather (Calluna vulgaris)
Heather is strongly associated with hunting landscapes in England and Scotland, where cocker spaniels were originally bred as flushing dogs for woodcock hunting. These dogs would work in heathlands, moorlands, and other terrains covered in heather, which made the flower symbolically tied to their history.

Most Important Plant in Cocker Spaniel History
ðŸŒ¿ Oak (Quercus spp.)
The English oak is significant because cocker spaniels were often used in wooded areas and forests where oak trees thrived. Their role as flushing and retrieving dogs made oak-rich woodlands a prime environment for their work. Additionally, oak forests were home to game birds like woodcocks, for which cocker spaniels were originally bred.
